# Socioeconomic-Predictors-of-ASCVD
Multiple machine learning models are used in the scope of this project to predict ASCVD using socioeconomic factors.

Accessing cardiovascular disease risks across different population
groups is crucial for improving healthcare treatments and tailoring
medical interventions to the specific needs of diverse communities.
This research seeks to create a predictive model to assess risk of
cardiovascular disease based on demographic factors such as gender,
ethnicity, socioeconomic status, education, etc. By processing through
medical records and public health datasets, data processing techniques
such as data cleaning, normalization, and feature selection will be used
to ensure the quality of the input data within the model. Additionally
advanced machine learning techniques such as multi-layer perceptron
(MLPs), random forests, and logistic regression will be trained to
predict outcomes and identify key risk factors for cardiovascular
diseases and hospitalization rates. After training and testing medical
and public health datasets with the model, we achieved a 89%
accuracy, demonstrating the modelâ€™s effectiveness in identifying
cardiological disease risks and predicting potential pulmonary diseases
within different population groups.
